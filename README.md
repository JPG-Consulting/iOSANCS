## ANCS (Apple Notification Center Service)
ANCS gives MetaWear a simple and convenient way to access many kinds of notifications that are generated on iOS devices.

This notification app demonstrates use of several advanced functionalities in the MetaWear platform including bonding, adding events, removing events, and customizing events.  With this app you can vibrate and flash the on-board LED a custom color based on the type of notification received by your Apple BLE Smart device (i.e get a call from dentist = flash LED red).

## ATTENTION!
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for dependency management, this means you need to open **ANCS.xcworkspace** and not ANCS.xcodeproj.
